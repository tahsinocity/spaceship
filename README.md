## Spaceship App
---
In this exercise, you will practice some bsaic React skills (creating class and functional components, passing props, accessing props). As you work through this exercise, pay attention to the data flow and how front-end applications can be put together.

### Objectives
* Initialize state appropriately
* Create nested components as necessary (stateful and / or functional)
* Dynamically render data
* Handle user input and appropriately respond to that input
* Create a diagram of the data flow of this application

### Getting Started
In this exercise, you'll be making an app that shows current spaceships in our fleet and allows us to add new spaceships.
* _Initial setup_: `npm install`
* _Run the app_: In a new terminal tab, start the application with `npm start`
* Make sure you `add` and `commit` frequently!

#### Minimum Requirements
1. Create a diagram of the data flow of this app
2. Complete all the user stories

#### Advanced Content
_Coming Soon_

## User Stories

**As a user, when I first see the landing page, I should be able to see all my spaceships.**

  - [ ] Dynamically renders all spaceships (no hardcoding, please)
  - [ ] Creates any appropriate components and correctly utilizes them

---------------------------------

**As a user, I should be able to create a new spaceship.**
